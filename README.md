## Requirements

⚠️ **This game requires:**
- Mac with Force Touch trackpad
- Safari browser

Other browsers or devices do not support the pressure-sensitive trackpad API used in this game.

## How to Play

1. **Press and hold** the trackpad to start growing the stick
2. **The harder you press, the longer the stick** — pressure directly controls stick length
3. A countdown timer will appear. When it reaches **0**, the stick length locks and the stick falls
4. If the stick reaches the next platform, your hero walks across. If not, game over!
5. Land on the **red zone** in the center of platforms for **double score**

## Tips

- Light pressure = short stick
- Hard pressure = long stick
- Watch the timer — you can't change the length after it hits 0
- Aim for the center red zone to maximize your score
